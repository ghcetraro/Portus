ActionView::Template::Error (undefined method `[]' for nil .

Solucion


Here's your problem, as specified in the documentation you should never modify the config/config.yml file. Instead you have two options described more thoroughly in the documentation:

    Provide a config/config-local.yml file with the values you want to change from the config/config-local.yml.
    Set environment variables (with the format described in the documentation).

All this is because the config/config.yml file acts as a file for default values, so Portus relies on this file being untouched.
